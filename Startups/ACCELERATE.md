# **GitHub Accelerate**

India has a vibrant tech startup community, with many entrepreneurs choosing GitHub to enable innovation. Last year, in partnership with a few leading venture partners in India, we ran a pilot program to provide access to GitHub Enterprise to startups in India. The pilot saw outstanding engagement, with nearly 200 startups signing up, including AirMeet, Kawa Space, and ClearQuote, to name a few.
