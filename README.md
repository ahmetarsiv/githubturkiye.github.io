## üßë‚Äçüíª  Open Source

The open-source ecosystem in India is thriving with many contributors & maintainers from India and open-source projects being built in India. We are here to help developers, contributors and maintainers in their journey towards open-source.

### Projects and Maintainers from India

There are many open-source projects that we might be using frequently, but unaware that it's a project that was created in or receiving significant contributions from India. We have collated some of the projects and maintainers from India on the [githubindia.com website](https://githubindia.com)

If you know of any other projects or maintainers from India, feel free to make a [contribution](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

### GitHub Grants for Open Source

At [GitHub Satellite India 2021](https://githubsatellite.com), we announced the GitHub India Grants for Open Source to support the open source community by providing monetary grants to contributors/maintainers, with a total monetary fund of INR 1 crore.

For details about the program and the grant recipients, [check out the announcement blog post](https://github.blog/2021-09-12-recipients-open-source-grants-github-sponsors-india/)


### Resources

If you are looking to make your first contribution to open source, or even an experienced maintainer looking for ways to grow your community ‚Äî we have resources to help you! Check out the [Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide) which has many resources on how to start an open-source project, build communities, best practices for maintainers, and a lot more!

### The ReadME Project

The ReadME Project is part of GitHub‚Äôs ongoing effort to amplify the voices of the developer community. It‚Äôs an evolving space to engage with the community and explore the stories, challenges, technology, and culture that surround the world of open source.

Check out the stories of [Shikha Mishra](https://github.com/readme/shikha-mishra), [Liyas Thomas](https://github.com/readme/stories/liyas-thomas) and [Karthik Iyer](https://github.com/readme/stories/karthik-iyer) from India
