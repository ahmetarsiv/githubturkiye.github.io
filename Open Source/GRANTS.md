# GitHub Grants for Open Source

Open source is the foundation of all great projects and the key to the future of software. GitHub is where open source communities live and supporting open source is at the very heart of GitHubâ€™s mission.

In India, there are thousands of Open Source projects thriving on GitHub. Some of the prominent ones have tens of thousands of users.

For supporting the great work of the Indian open-source developer community, we are excited to announce the GitHub Grants for Open Source program.

GitHub Grants for Open Source is GitHubâ€™s efforts in helping open source contributors and maintainers from India continue to build world-class software to make an impact for India and the world. We would be supporting them with a total monetary grant fund of INR 1 crore. Eligible contributors and maintainers can apply for the grant through the application process outlined. All applications will be reviewed and grant awards will be decided by an expert panel of jury members from the industry, government, academia and GitHub.

_Please note: The grants are currently open only for individual contributors and maintainers, and not teams or organizations._

## Who can apply

To be eligible to apply and receive a grant, an individual **MUST**:
- Have made significant contributions or be a maintainer of at least one open-source project
- Have an active online profile (preferably a GitHub Profile Readme) describing their work and contributions to open source
- Have an active bank account in India where the grant amount can be received, if declared
- Not be a current employee of GitHub and/or any of its parent/subsidiary companies

## What do we look for

While eligible individuals can apply and are considered, not all applicants would be awarded a grant. The applications would be thoroughly evaluated by a jury. An applicant's chances of being awarded a grant would significantly increase if they:
- Have made significant contributions to an open-source project/s, that has helped a large number of its users
- Have demonstrated means by which a grant would help them and the open-source project/s they contribute to or maintain
- Are actively involved in the open-source community and help their peers
